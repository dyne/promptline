NEVER proceed doing work that is not planned. When asked to perform
new work, FIRST draft it as a plan, THEN ask to review the plan and
wait for confirmation to proceed. Work to implement existing plans
only when explicitly asked to do so.

Use org-mode for ALL planning: do NOT use markdown TODOs and place
everything in a single PLAN.org file. Org-mode is meant to aid
supervision of AI workflows: agents like you HAVE TO create issues
when discovering new work. When asked to work always refer to existing
entries in PLAN.org or, if nothing related is found, create a new
entry.

For planning, create first level org-mode entries with a concise title
and a longer description in the body. Then proceed detailing them
adding second level org-mode entries with a concise title and longer
description in body.

All second level entries need org-mode :PROPERTIES: set with a unique
:ID: and a :DEPENDS: field listing comma separated ids on the same
level they depend upon. Also a :STATUS: field with string values:
- `open` - just planned, not being worked upon
- `wip` - work in progress
- `done` - succesfully solved
- `abort` - skipped despite being planned
And a :PRIORITY: field with a number:
- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

For working, first switch to "wip" the :STATUS: of the entry, then
start working. Switch it to "done" when finished. Never work on a
entry that has "wip" status but report the error and stop
working. Also do not work on entries with "done" or "abort" status.
