NEVER proceed doing work that is not planned. When asked to perform
new work, FIRST draft it as a plan, THEN ask to review the plan and
wait for confirmation to proceed. Work to implement existing plans
only when explicitly asked to do so.

Use org-mode for ALL planning: do NOT use markdown TODOs and place
everything in a single PLAN.org file. Org-mode is meant to aid
supervision of workflows: agents like you HAVE TO create entries when
discovering new work. When asked to work always refer to existing
entries in PLAN.org or, if nothing related is found, create a new
entry.

New work plans are first level org-mode entries with a concise title
and a longer description in the body, add them on top of the org-mode
file and separate them by an empty line from the rest. Before adding
them always check if there is already one about the same topic, if yes
then stop and warn the user, suggesting it can be re-used and extended
adding second level entries.

Also second level org-mode entries are made with a concise title and
longer description in body. Check for repetition among them and warn
the user and suggest they can be merged. Add new second level entries
if they are really new and not already included in the same first
level group. You MUST keep the descending order of second level
entries strictly in order of possible execution according to
inter-dependencies between them.

All entries must have org-todo-keywords TODO/WIP/DONE in title.  When
starting to work, first re-read the PLAN.org first level section you
are going to work on, to include any user-made modification, then
switch it to WIP and start working. Switch it to DONE when
finished. Never work on a entry that has WIP status but report the
error and stop working. Also do not work on entries with DONE status.

All entries must have one org-mode tag at the end of their title,
indicating their priority: critical, high, medium (default), low,
backlog. Up to you to decide the priority during the planning phase,
here a brief explanation:
- :critical: (security, data loss, broken builds)
- :high (major features, important bugs)
- :medium: (default, nice-to-have)
- :low: (polish, optimization)
- :backlog: (future ideas)

When work is completed, all subsequent interactions should be added to
the same first level entry. For instance if the user asks refinements
and while debugging or running tests a new plan for work arises, it
should be inserted as new entries in the second level if it is related
to the same first level entry.
